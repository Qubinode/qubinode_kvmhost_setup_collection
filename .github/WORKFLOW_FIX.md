# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix

## Issue Resolved

Fixed the GitHub Actions error:
```
Error: No event triggers defined in `on`
.github/workflows/future-compatibility-config.yml
```

## Root Cause

The file `future-compatibility-config.yml` was a configuration file (YAML data), not a GitHub Actions workflow file, but it was incorrectly placed in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

## Solution

1. **Moved configuration file**: 
   - From: `.github/workflows/future-compatibility-config.yml`
   - To: `.github/config/future-compatibility-config.yml`

2. **Validated all workflows**: All remaining workflow files in `.github/workflows/` are now properly formatted with valid `on:` triggers.

## Files Affected

- ✅ Moved: `.github/config/future-compatibility-config.yml` (configuration data)
- ✅ Kept: `.github/workflows/future-compatibility.yml` (proper workflow file)
- ✅ All other workflow files validated as correct

## Verification

```bash
# Check all workflow files are valid
for file in .github/workflows/*.yml; do 
  python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('$file'))" && echo "$file ✅ Valid"
done
```

The GitHub Actions should now run without the "No event triggers defined" error.
