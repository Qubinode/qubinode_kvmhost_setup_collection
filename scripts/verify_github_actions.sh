# GitHub Actions Verifier - The "CI/CD Validator"
# =============================================================================
#
# 🎯 PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script verifies that local automation exactly matches GitHub Actions workflow
# behavior, ensuring consistency between local and CI/CD environments.
#
# 🧠 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Workflow Simulation - Simulates exact GitHub Actions workflow steps
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Environment Validation - Verifies local environment matches CI/CD
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Step-by-Step Execution - Runs each workflow step locally
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Result Comparison - Compares local results with expected CI/CD outcomes
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Discrepancy Detection - Identifies differences between environments
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Validation Reporting - Reports workflow consistency and issues
#
# 🔧 HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE KVMHOST SETUP COLLECTION:
# - Simulates: Exact GitHub Actions workflow steps locally
# - Validates: Consistency between local development and CI/CD environments
# - Verifies: That local automation matches production CI/CD behavior
# - Prevents: Surprises when code reaches GitHub Actions runners
# - Ensures: Reproducible results across different execution environments
# - Integrates: With local testing workflows for comprehensive validation
#
# 📊 KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - FIDELITY: Exactly replicates GitHub Actions workflow behavior
# - CONSISTENCY: Ensures local and CI/CD environments produce identical results
# - VALIDATION: Verifies workflow correctness before code submission
# - DEBUGGING: Helps identify environment-specific issues
# - REPRODUCIBILITY: Ensures consistent behavior across execution contexts
# - INTEGRATION: Seamlessly integrates with existing development workflows
#
# 💡 WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - Workflow Changes: Update simulation when GitHub Actions workflows change
# - New Steps: Add simulation for new workflow steps or jobs
# - Environment Updates: Modify environment validation for new requirements
# - Integration: Add integration with new CI/CD platforms or tools
# - Reporting: Enhance reporting for better discrepancy identification
# - Automation: Add automated workflow synchronization capabilities
#
# 🚨 IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script must stay synchronized with actual
# GitHub Actions workflows. Discrepancies between this script and CI/CD
# workflows can lead to false confidence in local testing results.

# GitHub Actions Workflow Verification Script
# This script verifies that our automation does exactly what the GitHub Actions workflow claims
