# Platform Performance Analyst - The "Infrastructure Benchmarker"
# =============================================================================
#
# üéØ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script performs comprehensive analysis comparing Ubuntu GitHub Actions
# runners with self-hosted RHEL runners for Ansible collection testing.
#
# üß† ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Environment Detection - Identifies current runner platform and capabilities
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Performance Benchmarking - Measures performance across different platforms
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Compatibility Analysis - Analyzes compatibility differences between platforms
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Cost-Benefit Assessment - Evaluates cost implications of platform choices
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Feature Comparison - Compares available features across platforms
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Recommendation Engine - Provides data-driven platform recommendations
#
# üîß HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE KVMHOST SETUP COLLECTION:
# - Compares: Ubuntu vs RHEL runner performance for collection testing
# - Analyzes: Platform-specific advantages and limitations
# - Benchmarks: Testing performance and reliability across platforms
# - Evaluates: Cost-effectiveness of different runner infrastructure choices
# - Provides: Evidence-based recommendations for CI/CD platform selection
# - Supports: Infrastructure decision-making with concrete performance data
#
# üìä KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - COMPARATIVE: Direct comparison between platform options
# - PERFORMANCE-FOCUSED: Emphasizes performance metrics and benchmarking
# - DATA-DRIVEN: Provides concrete data for infrastructure decisions
# - COST-AWARE: Considers cost implications alongside technical factors
# - PRACTICAL: Focuses on real-world testing scenarios and requirements
# - EVIDENCE-BASED: Generates evidence to support platform selection decisions
#
# üí° WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - New Platforms: Add analysis for new runner platforms or cloud providers
# - Benchmarks: Add new performance benchmarks or testing scenarios
# - Cost Models: Update cost analysis for new pricing models
# - Features: Add analysis for new platform features or capabilities
# - Integration: Add integration with infrastructure management tools
# - Automation: Add automated platform recommendation systems
#
# üö® IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: Platform analysis affects infrastructure costs and
# performance. Ensure analysis reflects current pricing and capabilities.
# Recommendations should balance performance, cost, and operational complexity.
