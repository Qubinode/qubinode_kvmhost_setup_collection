# Container Health Monitor - The "Container Watchdog"
# =============================================================================
#
# üéØ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script monitors for stuck Molecule containers and provides cleanup guidance,
# helping maintain healthy container environments for testing and CI/CD.
#
# üß† ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Container Discovery - Scans for all running and stopped containers
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Molecule Identification - Identifies Molecule-related containers
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Health Assessment - Evaluates container health and responsiveness
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Stuck Detection - Identifies containers that are stuck or unresponsive
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Cleanup Guidance - Provides specific cleanup instructions
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Prevention Recommendations - Suggests preventive measures
#
# üîß HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE KVMHOST SETUP COLLECTION:
# - Monitors: Containers created by Molecule testing scenarios
# - Detects: Stuck containers that can block CI/CD pipelines
# - Guides: Cleanup procedures for container issues
# - Prevents: Resource exhaustion from accumulated containers
# - Supports: Both Podman and Docker container runtimes
# - Coordinates: With emergency-cleanup-containers.sh for resolution
#
# üìä KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - MONITORING: Continuously monitors container health and status
# - DETECTION: Identifies problematic containers before they cause issues
# - GUIDANCE: Provides clear instructions for resolving container problems
# - PREVENTION: Focuses on preventing container accumulation issues
# - COMPATIBILITY: Works with multiple container runtimes
# - SAFETY: Provides guidance without performing destructive operations
#
# üí° WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - New Runtimes: Add support for new container runtimes
# - Detection Logic: Improve stuck container detection algorithms
# - Cleanup Guidance: Enhance cleanup instruction specificity
# - Automation: Add automated cleanup capabilities (with safety checks)
# - Monitoring: Add performance monitoring and alerting
# - Integration: Add integration with container orchestration systems
#
# üö® IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script is diagnostic only - it doesn't perform
# cleanup automatically. Use emergency-cleanup-containers.sh for actual cleanup.
# Always review container status before performing destructive operations.

# Check for stuck molecule containers and provide cleanup instructions
# This can be run by developers or CI administrators
