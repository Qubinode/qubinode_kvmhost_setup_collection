# Enhanced Security Scanner - The "Security Guardian"
# =============================================================================
#
# ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script performs comprehensive security analysis of the Ansible collection,
# identifying vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and compliance issues.
#
# ðŸ§  ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Scan Preparation - Sets up security scanning environment and tools
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Code Analysis - Scans Python and shell scripts for security vulnerabilities
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Dependency Analysis - Checks dependencies for known vulnerabilities
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Configuration Analysis - Reviews security configurations and policies
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Ansible Security - Analyzes Ansible playbooks and roles for security issues
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Report Generation - Creates comprehensive security reports with remediation
#
# ðŸ”§ HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE KVMHOST SETUP COLLECTION:
# - Scans: All Python scripts, shell scripts, and Ansible content for vulnerabilities
# - Analyzes: Dependencies in requirements.txt, galaxy.yml for known CVEs
# - Validates: Security configurations in roles and playbooks
# - Reports: Findings to security-reports/ directory with timestamps
# - Integrates: With CI/CD pipeline for automated security validation
# - Monitors: Security posture continuously as code evolves
#
# ðŸ“Š KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - COMPREHENSIVE: Multi-layered security analysis covering all aspects
# - AUTOMATION: Fully automated scanning suitable for CI/CD integration
# - REPORTING: Detailed reports with severity levels and remediation guidance
# - INTEGRATION: Works with multiple security tools (bandit, safety, ansible-lint)
# - CONTINUOUS: Designed for regular execution to catch new vulnerabilities
# - ACTIONABLE: Provides specific remediation steps for identified issues
#
# ðŸ’¡ WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - New Tools: Add integration with new security scanning tools
# - Scan Types: Add new categories of security analysis
# - Report Format: Modify report structure for new consumer requirements
# - Thresholds: Adjust severity thresholds and failure criteria
# - Integration: Add hooks for security information systems or SIEM tools
# - Performance: Optimize scanning for larger codebases
#
# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script identifies security vulnerabilities that
# could compromise system security. Always address HIGH and CRITICAL findings
# immediately. Review all findings carefully and implement recommended fixes.

# Enhanced Security Scan Script
# Performs comprehensive security analysis of the collection

# Use pipefail but don't exit on errors (let script handle them gracefully)
