# Security Noise Filter - The "False Positive Analyst"
# =============================================================================
#
# üéØ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script analyzes and filters security scanning false positives,
# helping distinguish between legitimate security concerns and scanner noise.
#
# üß† ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Scan Result Analysis - Analyzes security scanner output for patterns
# 2. [PHASE 2]: False Positive Detection - Identifies known false positive patterns
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Context Analysis - Examines code context to validate findings
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Pattern Classification - Classifies findings as legitimate or false positive
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Filter Application - Applies filters to reduce noise in security reports
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Clean Report Generation - Produces filtered reports with real issues only
#
# üîß HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE KVMHOST SETUP COLLECTION:
# - Filters: Security scan results from enhanced-security-scan.sh
# - Reduces: False positive noise in security reports
# - Improves: Signal-to-noise ratio in security analysis
# - Supports: Accurate security assessment by removing scanner artifacts
# - Integrates: With CI/CD security validation pipelines
# - Maintains: Database of known false positive patterns
#
# üìä KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - INTELLIGENCE: Uses pattern recognition to identify false positives
# - CONTEXT-AWARE: Analyzes code context to validate security findings
# - LEARNING: Maintains patterns database that improves over time
# - ACCURACY: Focuses on improving security analysis accuracy
# - EFFICIENCY: Reduces manual review time by filtering noise
# - INTEGRATION: Works seamlessly with existing security scanning tools
#
# üí° WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - New Patterns: Add new false positive patterns as they're discovered
# - Scanner Updates: Update filters for new security scanner versions
# - Context Analysis: Improve context analysis algorithms
# - Integration: Add support for new security scanning tools
# - Machine Learning: Add ML-based false positive detection
# - Reporting: Enhance filtered report generation and formatting
#
# üö® IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script filters security findings. Be extremely
# careful when adding new false positive patterns - never filter legitimate
# security issues. Always validate patterns thoroughly before implementation.

# Script to analyze and fix security scanning false positives
# This script helps identify legitimate content that security scanners flag incorrectly
