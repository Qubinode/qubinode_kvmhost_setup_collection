# Container-Only Molecule Tester - The "Containerization Specialist"
# =============================================================================
#
# 🎯 PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script tests Molecule scenarios using pure container configurations,
# avoiding problematic test-host inventory issues and focusing on containerized testing.
#
# 🧠 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Environment Activation - Sources Molecule virtual environment
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Version Validation - Verifies Python, Ansible, and Molecule versions
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Container Configuration - Sets up container-only testing parameters
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Inventory Bypass - Avoids problematic test-host inventory configurations
# 5. [PHASE 5]: Scenario Execution - Runs Molecule tests in pure container mode
# 6. [PHASE 6]: Results Validation - Verifies container-only testing success
#
# 🔧 HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE KVMHOST SETUP COLLECTION:
# - Tests: Ansible roles in pure containerized environments
# - Avoids: Host inventory issues that can cause testing failures
# - Focuses: On container-specific testing scenarios and configurations
# - Validates: Role functionality without host system dependencies
# - Supports: CI/CD pipelines with container-only testing requirements
# - Complements: Full testing suites with specialized container validation
#
# 📊 KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - ISOLATION: Pure container testing without host system dependencies
# - SIMPLIFICATION: Avoids complex inventory configurations that cause issues
# - FOCUS: Concentrates on containerized execution environments
# - RELIABILITY: Reduces testing failures from inventory configuration problems
# - SPECIALIZATION: Designed for specific container-only testing scenarios
# - COMPLEMENTARY: Works alongside comprehensive testing suites
#
# 💡 WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - Container Platforms: Add support for new container runtimes or platforms
# - Test Scenarios: Extend container-only testing scenarios
# - Configuration: Modify container configuration parameters
# - Integration: Add integration with new containerization tools
# - Validation: Enhance container-specific validation checks
# - Performance: Optimize container testing for faster execution
#
# 🚨 IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This script is designed for container-only testing.
# It intentionally avoids host inventory configurations that can cause issues.
# Use this when you need pure containerized testing without host dependencies.

# Test Molecule with Container-Only Configuration
# This script tests molecule scenarios without the problematic test-host inventory
