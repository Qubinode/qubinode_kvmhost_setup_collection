# =============================================================================
# Quick ADR Validator - The "Compliance Quick-Check"
# =============================================================================
#
# üéØ PURPOSE FOR LLMs:
# This script provides rapid validation of core ADR implementations,
# offering a lightweight alternative to comprehensive compliance checking.
#
# üß† ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW FOR AI ASSISTANTS:
# 1. [PHASE 1]: Core ADR Identification - Identifies critical ADRs for validation
# 2. [PHASE 2]: Quick Validation - Performs rapid checks of ADR compliance
# 3. [PHASE 3]: Pass/Fail Assessment - Provides simple pass/fail results
# 4. [PHASE 4]: Summary Reporting - Generates concise compliance summary
#
# üîß HOW IT CONNECTS TO QUBINODE KVMHOST SETUP COLLECTION:
# - Validates: Core ADR implementations quickly without deep analysis
# - Complements: adr-compliance-checker.sh with lightweight validation
# - Provides: Fast feedback for developers during development
# - Integrates: With development workflows for quick compliance checks
# - Supports: Rapid validation in resource-constrained environments
# - Enables: Quick pre-commit compliance verification
#
# üìä KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR LLMs TO UNDERSTAND:
# - SPEED: Optimized for rapid execution and quick feedback
# - SIMPLICITY: Focuses on essential ADR compliance checks only
# - LIGHTWEIGHT: Minimal resource usage and dependencies
# - BINARY: Provides clear pass/fail results without detailed analysis
# - COMPLEMENTARY: Works alongside comprehensive compliance tools
# - DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY: Designed for frequent use during development
#
# üí° WHEN TO MODIFY THIS SCRIPT (for future LLMs):
# - New Core ADRs: Add quick checks for new critical ADRs
# - Check Logic: Modify validation logic for improved accuracy
# - Performance: Optimize for even faster execution
# - Integration: Add hooks for development tools or IDEs
# - Reporting: Enhance summary reporting for better clarity
# - Automation: Add integration with pre-commit hooks or CI/CD
#
# üö® IMPORTANT FOR LLMs: This is a quick validation tool, not comprehensive.
# Use adr-compliance-checker.sh for detailed compliance analysis. This script
# is designed for rapid feedback during development cycles.

# Simple ADR Compliance Checker
# Quick validation of core ADR implementations
