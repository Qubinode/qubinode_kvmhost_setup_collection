echo "🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION:"
echo "========================"
echo ""
echo "✅ REMOVE the complex 800-line dependency testing pipeline"
echo "✅ USE Ubuntu runners for 90% of CI/CD (syntax, security, containers)"
echo "✅ KEEP self-hosted RHEL runner for critical integration tests only"
echo "✅ SAVE ~\$50-100/month in infrastructure costs"
echo "✅ REDUCE maintenance burden by 80%"
echo ""

echo "💰 COST COMPARISON:"
echo "Current: Self-hosted RHEL server (~\$50-100/month + maintenance)"
echo "Proposed: Ubuntu (FREE) + minimal self-hosted usage"
echo "Savings: ~80% cost reduction"
echo ""

echo "⚡ COMPLEXITY COMPARISON:"
echo "Current: 800+ lines of complex dependency pipeline"
echo "Proposed: ~50 lines of simple, effective testing"
echo "Maintenance: ~90% reduction in complexity"
echo ""

echo "🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:"
echo "1. Update .github/workflows/ to use 'ubuntu-latest'"
echo "2. Remove complex dependency testing scripts (over-engineered)"
echo "3. Keep basic security scanning (simple)"
echo "4. Use self-hosted runner only for final integration tests"
echo "5. Update TODO.md to reflect simplified approach"
