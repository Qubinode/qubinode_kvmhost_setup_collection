# Key Research Findings Summary
**RHEL 9/10 Support & CI/CD Automation Research**

**Completion Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Full Report**: [research-results-july-11-2025.md](research-results-july-11-2025.md)

## 🔍 Critical Discoveries

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Self-hosted GitHub Actions runners are ESSENTIAL** for KVM/libvirt testing
  - Cloud-hosted runners lack hardware virtualization support
  - Investment required for accurate testing infrastructure

### Architectural Changes
- **RHEL 9.4 deprecates monolithic libvirtd daemon**
  - Must migrate to modular libvirt daemons
  - Requires careful transition planning and testing

### Multi-Distribution Strategy
- **Support entire RHEL ecosystem**: RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream
- **Multi-registry Dependabot configuration** needed across registries
- **Container optimization**: Use Minimal/Micro for CI speed, Base/Default for functional tests

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Complement, Don't Replace
- **Leverage existing migration tools** (Leapp, migrate2rocky, ELevate)
- **Focus on pre/post-migration validation** and configuration re-application
- **Provide value-add automation** rather than duplicating OS-level functionality

### 2. Tiered Testing Strategy
- **Smoke tests** → **Full tests** → **Distribution-specific tests**
- **Progressive testing** for efficiency and cost management
- **Red Hat Testing Farm integration** for official RHEL environment validation

### 3. Performance & Security Leadership
- **KVM optimizations**: CPU pinning, hugepages, virtio I/O threads
- **Modern security**: Post-quantum cryptography, FIPS compliance, advanced SELinux
- **Continuous monitoring**: perf kvm integration and automated security scanning

## 📋 Implementation Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate - 2 months)
```
HIGH PRIORITY:
✅ Deploy self-hosted GitHub Actions runners with KVM
✅ Configure multi-registry Dependabot (Red Hat, Quay.io, Docker Hub)
✅ Implement tiered CI/CD testing strategy
✅ Establish RHEL 10 production testing track (now GA since Red Hat Summit May 2025)
```

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Months 3-4)
```
HIGH PRIORITY:
🔧 Implement conditional logic for distribution-aware roles
🔧 Integrate KVM/libvirt performance optimizations
🔧 Develop modular libvirt daemon support
🔧 Implement universal security baselines
```

### Phase 3: Production (Months 5-6)
```
MEDIUM PRIORITY:
🚀 Integrate performance benchmarking in CI/CD
🚀 Complete Red Hat Testing Farm integration
🚀 Develop comprehensive migration documentation
🚀 Establish community feedback channels
```

## 💡 Key Technical Insights

### Dependabot Limitations
- **Cannot handle complex Containerfiles** or multi-stage builds effectively
- **Requires manual oversight** for comprehensive container image tracking
- **Multi-registry configuration** essential for RHEL ecosystem coverage

### Distribution Compatibility Approaches
- **Rocky Linux**: 1:1 binary compatibility (minimal adjustments needed)
- **AlmaLinux**: ABI compatibility (may require more nuanced handling)
- **CentOS Stream**: Upstream development branch (early warning system)

### Testing Environment Considerations
- **Container testing** suitable for basic functionality and integration
- **Self-hosted bare-metal** required for KVM performance and hardware features
- **Red Hat Testing Farm** provides official RHEL environment validation
