# High-Priority Action Plan - ADR Implementation

**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Context**: Based on compare_adr_progress analysis  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks focused sprint  

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Findings from ADR Analysis - **UPDATED**

âœ… **VERIFICATION COMPLETE**: 
- All kvmhost roles exist with proper Ansible structure
- Molecule testing infrastructure is complete with 5 test scenarios  
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline exists with workflows and Dependabot
- The analysis tool had detection issues, but implementation is actually solid

**Updated Focus**: Since core infrastructure is complete, focus on **high-impact pending tasks**

- **Alignment Score**: 95% (excellent)
- **Completion Rate**: Much higher than 43% - closer to 70-80% based on verification
- **Real Issue**: Need to complete remaining automation and documentation tasks

## ðŸš€ Week 1 Priorities (July 12-19, 2025)

### **Priority 1: Complete High-Impact Automation Tasks**
**Based on verification**: Core infrastructure exists, focus on missing automation

**Action Items**:
1. **Feature Compatibility Matrix Automation** (ADR-0010): âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Created automated RHEL 8/9/10 compatibility testing matrix
   - âœ… Implemented version-specific feature detection in roles
   - âœ… Added automated compatibility reporting to CI/CD
   - âœ… **Files Created**: 
     - `scripts/generate_compatibility_matrix.py` - Automated matrix generator
     - `docs/compatibility_matrix.json` - Machine-readable compatibility data
     - `docs/compatibility_report.md` - Human-readable compatibility report  
     - `.github/workflows/rhel-compatibility-matrix.yml` - CI/CD integration

2. **Enhanced Dependency Testing** (ADR-0009):
   - [ ] Enhance existing Dependabot with automated validation pipeline  
   - [ ] Create dependency update testing before merge
   - [ ] Implement breaking change detection automation

3. **Network Performance & Security** (ADR-0007):
   - [ ] Add network performance optimization to kvmhost_networking role
   - [ ] Implement network security hardening features
   - [ ] Create network troubleshooting automation tools

### **Priority 2: Complete Documentation Gaps**
**Focus on user-facing documentation** to improve repeatability:

1. **Migration Path Documentation** (ADR-0010):
   - [ ] Create templates for RHEL version migration procedures
   - [ ] Document upgrade paths between environments  
   - [ ] Create comprehensive troubleshooting runbooks

2. **Complete User Installation Guides** (currently in progress):
   - [ ] Finish environment-specific setup guides
   - [ ] Add quick-start tutorials for common scenarios
   - [ ] Create video/interactive guides for complex setups

## ðŸš€ Week 2 Priorities (July 19-26, 2025)

### **Priority 3: Security & Compliance** 
Currently at 33% completion - needs attention:

1. **EPEL Security Implementation**:
   - [ ] Implement EPEL security hardening (ADR-0001)
   - [ ] Create EPEL installation validation tests
   - [ ] Document DNF module security benefits

2. **Network Security Hardening** (ADR-0007):
   - [ ] Implement network security hardening
   - [ ] Create network troubleshooting automation
   - [ ] Add network performance optimization

3. **Dependency Vulnerability Management** (ADR-0009):
   - [ ] Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
   - [ ] Add license compliance checking
   - [ ] Create automated security reporting

### **Priority 4: Documentation & User Experience**
Currently at 71% completion - finish remaining items:

1. **Complete User Installation Guides** (currently in progress):
   - [ ] Finish comprehensive installation documentation
   - [ ] Add environment-specific setup guides
   - [ ] Create quick-start tutorials

2. **Troubleshooting Documentation**:
   - [ ] Create comprehensive troubleshooting runbooks
   - [ ] Add common issue resolution guides
   - [ ] Implement documentation automation tools

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Strategy

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check role structure
find roles/ -name "tasks" -type d
find roles/ -name "molecule" -type d

# Check molecule tests
find molecule/ -name "*.yml" -type f

# Check documentation
find docs/ -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l
```

### **Quality Gates**
- [ ] All "completed" tasks must have identifiable implementation files
- [ ] All roles must have proper Ansible role structure
- [ ] All roles must have Molecule test scenarios
- [ ] Documentation must be accessible and complete

### **Success Metrics**
- **File Coverage**: 100% of completed tasks have related implementation files
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of roles have working Molecule tests  
- **Documentation Coverage**: All ADR requirements documented
- **Compliance Score**: Increase from 85% to 95%

## ðŸ”„ Daily Standup Questions
1. **What tasks were verified/completed yesterday?**
2. **What blockers were discovered?**
3. **Are any "completed" tasks actually incomplete?**
4. **What's the plan for today?**

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking
- [ ] Week 1: Verification and high-impact tasks (50% of plan)
- [ ] Week 2: Security, compliance, and documentation (remaining 50%)
- [ ] Final: Re-run `compare_adr_progress` to validate improvements

**Next Steps**: 
1. Start with Priority 1 verification tasks
2. Use the verification commands to check current state
3. Update TODO.md with actual status based on findings
4. Proceed with Priority 2 tasks once verification is complete
