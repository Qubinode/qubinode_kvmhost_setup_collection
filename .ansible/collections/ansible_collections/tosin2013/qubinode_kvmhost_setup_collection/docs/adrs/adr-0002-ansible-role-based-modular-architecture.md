# ADR-0002: Ansible Role-Based Modular Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project manages complex KVM host setup, edge host validation, and LVM configuration tasks. These operations involve multiple interconnected components including virtualization, networking, storage, and system configuration that need to be organized in a maintainable and reusable way. 

Without proper organization, these tasks would become a monolithic, hard-to-maintain codebase that would be difficult to test, debug, and extend.

## Decision
Adopt a modular Ansible role-based architecture to organize all automation tasks into discrete, reusable roles. Each role encapsulates related functionality with standardized directory structure including tasks, handlers, variables, defaults, templates, and documentation.

The project implements three main roles:
1. **kvmhost_setup**: Complete KVM host configuration including libvirt, networking, and storage
2. **edge_hosts_validate**: Validation of filesystem, packages, and RHSM registration
3. **swygue_lvm**: LVM management and configuration

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic playbook structure** - All tasks in single large playbooks without role separation
2. **Single large playbook** with all tasks inline - Would be difficult to maintain and test
3. **Separate standalone scripts** for each configuration task - Would lose Ansible benefits and create inconsistent execution patterns
4. **External tooling integration** without Ansible abstraction - Would require managing multiple tool ecosystems

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved code organization** through encapsulated, reusable components
- **Enhanced maintainability** with clear separation of concerns
- **Better reusability** - roles can be used across multiple playbooks and projects
- **Easier testing** - each role can be tested independently using Molecule
- **Community sharing** - roles follow Ansible Galaxy standards and can be shared
- **Modular development** - teams can work on different roles independently
- **Clear documentation** - each role has its own README and variable documentation

### Negative
- **Initial complexity** - requires understanding of Ansible role structure
- **Overhead** - more directory structure and files to manage
- **Learning curve** - team members need to understand role-based development

## Implementation
- Created `roles/` directory with three main roles
- Each role follows standard Ansible structure:
  - `tasks/` - Main automation tasks
  - `handlers/` - Event-driven tasks
  - `vars/` - Role-specific variables
  - `defaults/` - Default variable values
  - `templates/` - Jinja2 templates
  - `meta/` - Role metadata and dependencies
  - `README.md` - Role documentation
- Established clear naming conventions and documentation standards
- Integrated with Molecule testing framework for role validation

## Evidence
- `roles/kvmhost_setup/` - Complete KVM host setup role
- `roles/edge_hosts_validate/` - Host validation role
- `roles/swygue_lvm/` - LVM management role
- Each role contains standardized subdirectories and documentation
- Molecule testing configuration in `molecule/` directory
