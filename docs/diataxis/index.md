## üìã Documentation Principles

### Audience Separation

**End-User Documentation** (Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanations):
- Focuses on using the deployed collection
- Assumes collection is installed from Ansible Galaxy
- No development environment setup required
- Production-ready examples and configurations

**Developer Documentation** (Developer How-To Guides):
- Focuses on contributing to the collection
- Requires development environment setup
- Source code access and modification
- Testing and build processes

### Content Characteristics

#### Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)
- **Hands-on**: You actually configure systems
- **Safe**: Won't break existing setups when followed correctly
- **Progressive**: Each tutorial builds on previous knowledge
- **Outcome-focused**: Clear learning objectives

#### How-To Guides (Problem-Oriented)
- **Goal-oriented**: Solve specific problems efficiently
- **Practical**: Real-world scenarios and solutions
- **Assumes knowledge**: Basic familiarity with the collection
- **Task-focused**: Get from problem to solution quickly

#### Reference (Information-Oriented)
- **Comprehensive**: Complete coverage of features
- **Factual**: Based directly on code and specifications
- **Searchable**: Organized for quick lookup
- **Precise**: Exact syntax and parameters

#### Explanations (Understanding-Oriented)
- **Conceptual**: Explains the "why" behind decisions
- **Contextual**: Provides broader perspective
- **Discussion-oriented**: Explores topics in depth
- **Connects ideas**: Shows relationships between concepts

## üîÑ Documentation Maintenance

### Documentation-as-Code Approach

This documentation follows the "documentation-as-code" principle:

1. **Version Controlled**: Documentation lives alongside code
2. **Automated Updates**: Generated from code annotations where possible
3. **Review Process**: Documentation changes go through same review as code
4. **Continuous Integration**: Documentation is tested and validated

### Update Process

When code changes, documentation is updated following this process:

1. **Identify Impact**: Determine which documentation sections are affected
2. **Update Content**: Modify relevant documentation files
3. **Validate Changes**: Ensure accuracy and completeness
4. **Review Process**: Documentation changes reviewed with code changes

### Quality Assurance

- **Accuracy**: Documentation tested against actual code behavior
- **Completeness**: All features and options documented
- **Clarity**: Written for the intended audience
- **Currency**: Kept up-to-date with code changes
