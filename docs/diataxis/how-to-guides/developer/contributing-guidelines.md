# How to Contribute to the Project

This guide walks you through the complete contribution process, from identifying what to work on to getting your changes merged.

## üéØ Goal

Successfully contribute to the Qubinode KVM Host Setup Collection by:
- Following established workflows and standards
- Writing quality code that passes all checks
- Creating effective pull requests
- Collaborating effectively with maintainers

## üìã Prerequisites

- Completed [Set Up Development Environment](setup-development-environment.md)
- Completed [Run Molecule Tests](run-molecule-tests.md)
- Familiarity with Git workflows
- Understanding of Ansible best practices

## üöÄ Step 1: Find Something to Work On

### Check Existing Issues
```bash
# Browse issues on GitHub
# https://github.com/Qubinode/qubinode_kvmhost_setup_collection/issues

# Look for labels:
# - "good first issue" - Great for new contributors
# - "help wanted" - Community contributions welcome
# - "bug" - Bug fixes needed
# - "enhancement" - New features
```

### Identify Improvement Areas
- Review [TODO.md](../../../TODO.md) for planned work
- Check [Architecture Decision Records](../../../docs/adrs/) for implementation needs
- Look at failing tests in CI/CD
- Review user feedback and feature requests

### Propose New Features
```bash
# Create feature proposal issue
# Include:
# - Clear problem statement
# - Proposed solution
# - Implementation approach
# - Testing strategy
```

## üìù Step 2: Plan Your Contribution

### Create Implementation Plan
1. **Understand the scope** - What exactly needs to be changed?
2. **Identify affected components** - Which roles, files, tests?
3. **Plan testing approach** - How will you validate the changes?
4. **Consider breaking changes** - Will this affect existing users?

### Check Architecture Compliance
```bash
# Review relevant ADRs
ls docs/adrs/
cat docs/adrs/adr-0002-ansible-role-based-modular-architecture.md

# Run compliance checks
scripts/check-compliance.sh
```

## üîß Step 3: Implement Your Changes

### Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### Follow Coding Standards

#### Ansible Best Practices
```yaml
# Use descriptive task names
- name: "Install libvirt packages for KVM host setup"
  ansible.builtin.package:
    name: "{{ libvirt_packages }}"
    state: present

# Use proper variable naming
kvm_host_bridge_name: "qubibr0"  # Good
bridge: "qubibr0"                # Avoid

# Include proper tags
- name: "Configure network bridge"
  tags:
    - networking
    - bridge_config
```

#### File Organization
```bash
# Follow role structure
roles/role_name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ defaults/main.yml      # Default variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ handlers/main.yml      # Handlers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meta/main.yml         # Role metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/main.yml        # Main tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/            # Jinja2 templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vars/main.yml         # Role variables
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Role documentation
```

### Write Tests for Your Changes

#### Create Molecule Tests
```bash
# Navigate to role directory
cd roles/your_role

# Create test scenario if needed
molecule init scenario your-test

# Edit test playbook
vim molecule/your-test/converge.yml
```

#### Write Verification Tests
```python
# In molecule/default/tests/test_your_feature.py
def test_your_feature(host):
    """Test that your feature works correctly."""
    # Test service is running
    service = host.service("your-service")
    assert service.is_running
    
    # Test configuration file exists
    config = host.file("/etc/your-service/config.conf")
    assert config.exists
    assert config.contains("expected_setting")
```

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Validate Your Changes

### Run Local Tests
```bash
# Test the specific role you modified
cd roles/modified_role
molecule test

# Run collection-wide tests
cd ../..
scripts/test-local-molecule.sh

# Run linting
ansible-lint .
yamllint .
```

### Test Integration
```bash
# Test role interactions
ansible-playbook -i inventories/molecule/hosts test-modular.yml

# Test with different variables
ansible-playbook -i inventories/molecule/hosts test-modular.yml \
  -e "custom_test_var=value"
```

### Security and Compliance
```bash
# Run security scans
scripts/enhanced-security-scan.sh

# Check compliance
scripts/check-compliance.sh

# Validate against ADRs
scripts/adr-compliance-checker.sh
```

## üì§ Step 5: Submit Your Contribution

### Prepare Your Commits

#### Write Good Commit Messages
```bash
# Follow conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat(kvmhost_base): add support for custom package repositories

- Add repository configuration variables

# For bug fixes
git commit -m "fix(kvmhost_networking): resolve bridge creation race condition

- Add proper wait conditions for NetworkManager
- Improve error handling for bridge conflicts
- Add additional validation checks
- Fixes #456"
```

#### Organize Your Commits
```bash
# Squash related commits if needed
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Ensure clean commit history
git log --oneline -5
```

### Create Pull Request
