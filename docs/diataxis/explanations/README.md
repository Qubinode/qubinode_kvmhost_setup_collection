# Explanations - Understanding-Oriented Documentation

Welcome to the Explanations section! This is where we explore the "why" behind the Qubinode KVM Host Setup Collection - the concepts, architecture, design decisions, and broader context that will help you understand how and why the collection works the way it does.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

Explanations are **understanding-oriented** and designed to:
- Clarify concepts and design decisions
- Provide context for architectural choices
- Explain the reasoning behind implementation approaches
- Help you understand the bigger picture
- Connect individual features to overall goals

- **Is discussion-oriented** - Explores topics in depth
- **Assumes curiosity** - Written for those who want to understand deeply

## 🧠 Understanding the Collection

### Conceptual Framework
The collection is built on several key concepts:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each role has a specific responsibility
2. **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to run multiple times
3. **Platform Abstraction**: Works across RHEL-based distributions
4. **Testing-First Development**: Comprehensive testing at all levels
5. **Documentation-as-Code**: Documentation maintained with code

### Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: Make complex tasks simple for users
- **Reliability**: Consistent, predictable behavior
- **Flexibility**: Configurable for different environments
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Security**: Secure by default, with hardening options
