# Modular Role Design Philosophy

This document explains why the Qubinode KVM Host Setup Collection adopts a modular role-based architecture and how this design philosophy benefits users, developers, and the overall project ecosystem.

## 🎯 Why Modular Design?

### The Problem with Monolithic Approaches

Traditional "all-in-one" automation approaches suffer from several limitations:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Changes to one feature affect unrelated functionality
2. **Testing Complexity**: Difficult to test individual components in isolation
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Large, complex roles are hard to understand and modify
4. **Reusability Issues**: Can't use parts of the functionality independently
5. **Collaboration Challenges**: Multiple developers working on the same large codebase

### The Modular Solution

Our modular approach addresses these challenges by:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each role has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Loose Coupling**: Roles interact through well-defined interfaces
3. **Independent Testing**: Each role can be tested and validated separately
4. **Selective Usage**: Users can choose which components they need
5. **Parallel Development**: Teams can work on different roles simultaneously

## 🏗️ Architectural Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

Each role focuses on one specific aspect of KVM host management:

**kvmhost_base**: Foundation
- OS detection and validation
- Base package installation
- Essential service configuration
- EPEL repository management

**kvmhost_networking**: Network Infrastructure
- Bridge creation and management
- Network interface configuration
- Connectivity validation

**kvmhost_libvirt**: Virtualization Platform
- Libvirt daemon configuration
- Virtual network management
- Hardware feature detection

**kvmhost_storage**: Storage Management
- Storage pool creation
- LVM configuration
- Performance optimization

**kvmhost_cockpit**: Management Interface
- Web interface installation
- SSL configuration
- User access management

**kvmhost_user_config**: User Environment
- User account management
- Shell configuration
- Development tools

### 2. Dependency Inversion Principle

Roles depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:

```yaml
# Instead of hard-coding specific implementations
tasks:
  - name: Configure bridge
    command: brctl addbr br0  # Concrete implementation

# We use abstracted interfaces
tasks:
  - name: Configure bridge
    community.general.nmcli:  # Abstract interface
      conn_name: "{{ bridge_name }}"
      type: bridge
```

### 3. Interface Segregation

Each role exposes only the interfaces it needs:

```yaml
# kvmhost_networking role interface
input_interface:
  required_vars:
    - kvm_host_interface
    - qubinode_bridge_name
  optional_vars:
    - bridge_config
    - validation_enabled

output_interface:
  facts_provided:
    - bridge_created
    - primary_interface_detected
    - network_validation_results
```

## 🔄 Role Interaction Patterns

### 1. Sequential Dependency Pattern

Roles execute in a specific order based on dependencies:

```
kvmhost_base (foundation)
├── kvmhost_networking (requires: base)
├── kvmhost_user_config (requires: base)
└── kvmhost_libvirt (requires: base, networking)
    ├── kvmhost_storage (requires: base, libvirt)
    └── kvmhost_cockpit (requires: base, libvirt)
```

### 2. Configuration Inheritance Pattern

Roles inherit and extend configuration from their dependencies:

```yaml
# kvmhost_base provides
base_packages: [curl, wget, git]

# kvmhost_libvirt extends
libvirt_packages: "{{ base_packages + ['libvirt-daemon', 'qemu-kvm'] }}"

# kvmhost_storage further extends
storage_packages: "{{ libvirt_packages + ['lvm2', 'parted'] }}"
```

### 3. Event-Driven Pattern

Roles communicate through Ansible facts and handlers:

```yaml
# kvmhost_networking sets facts
- name: Set bridge creation fact
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    bridge_created: true
    bridge_name: "{{ qubinode_bridge_name }}"

# kvmhost_libvirt uses these facts
- name: Configure libvirt network
  when: bridge_created | default(false)
```

## 🎨 Design Benefits

### For End Users

#### Flexibility
Users can choose which components to deploy:
```yaml
# Minimal setup - just base and libvirt
roles:
  - kvmhost_base
  - kvmhost_libvirt

# Full setup - all components
roles:
  - kvmhost_setup  # Orchestrates all roles
```

#### Customization
Each role can be configured independently:
```yaml
# Custom networking without storage
- role: kvmhost_networking
  vars:
    qubinode_bridge_name: "custom-br0"
    network_validation_enabled: false

# Skip user configuration
- role: kvmhost_setup
  vars:
    configure_shell: false
```

#### Troubleshooting
Issues can be isolated to specific components:
```bash
# Test only networking
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags networking

# Skip problematic components
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags cockpit
```

### For Developers

#### Focused Development
Developers can focus on specific areas of expertise:
- **Network specialists** work on kvmhost_networking
- **Storage experts** enhance kvmhost_storage
- **Security teams** improve kvmhost_base

#### Independent Testing
Each role has its own test suite:
```bash
# Test individual roles
cd roles/kvmhost_networking
molecule test

# Test role interactions
ansible-playbook test-modular.yml
```

#### Parallel Development
Multiple teams can work simultaneously:
- Team A: Enhancing storage management
- Team B: Improving network configuration
- Team C: Adding new user features

### For Operations

#### Selective Deployment
Deploy only needed components:
```yaml
# Edge deployment - minimal footprint
roles:
  - kvmhost_base
  - kvmhost_libvirt

# Full datacenter deployment
roles:
  - kvmhost_setup  # Everything
```

#### Incremental Updates
Update components independently:
```bash
# Update only networking components
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags networking

# Update storage without affecting network
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags storage
```

## 🔧 Implementation Strategies

### 1. Role Interface Design

Each role defines clear interfaces:

```yaml
# Role input interface (defaults/main.yml)
role_input:
  required_variables:
    - admin_user
    - kvm_host_interface
  optional_variables:
    - custom_config
    - feature_flags

# Role output interface (facts set)
role_output:
  facts_provided:
    - component_configured
    - configuration_status
    - validation_results
```

### 2. Configuration Management

Centralized configuration with role-specific overrides:

```yaml
# Global configuration (group_vars/all.yml)
admin_user: "kvmadmin"
kvm_host_domain: "lab.example.com"

# Role-specific configuration (host_vars/host.yml)
kvmhost_networking_bridge_name: "custom-br0"
kvmhost_storage_pool_size: "100G"
```

### 3. Error Handling Strategy

Each role implements consistent error handling:

```yaml
# Validation with clear error messages
- name: Validate required variables
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - admin_user is defined
      - admin_user | length > 0
    fail_msg: "admin_user must be defined and non-empty"

# Graceful degradation
- name: Optional feature configuration
  block:
    - name: Configure advanced feature
      # ... configuration tasks
  rescue:
    - name: Log feature unavailable
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Advanced feature not available, continuing with basic setup"
```

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
The modular design supports scaling across multiple hosts:

```yaml
# Different roles for different host types
- hosts: kvm_compute_nodes
  roles:
    - kvmhost_base
    - kvmhost_libvirt
    - kvmhost_storage

- hosts: kvm_management_nodes
  roles:
    - kvmhost_base
    - kvmhost_cockpit
    - kvmhost_user_config
```

### Vertical Scaling
Roles adapt to different resource levels:

```yaml
# High-performance configuration
kvmhost_libvirt_performance_mode: high
kvmhost_storage_use_ssd: true
kvmhost_networking_jumbo_frames: true

# Resource-constrained configuration
kvmhost_libvirt_performance_mode: minimal
kvmhost_storage_use_compression: true
```

## 🔄 Evolution and Extensibility

### Adding New Roles

The modular design makes it easy to add new functionality:

```yaml
# New role: kvmhost_monitoring
dependencies:
  - kvmhost_base  # Foundation
  - kvmhost_libvirt  # For VM metrics

responsibilities:
  - Monitoring agent installation
  - Metrics collection configuration
  - Alerting setup
```

### Extending Existing Roles

Roles can be extended without breaking existing functionality:

```yaml
# kvmhost_storage extension for cloud storage
new_features:
  - cloud_storage_integration
  - automated_backup
  - disaster_recovery

backward_compatibility:
  - existing_variables_preserved
  - default_behavior_unchanged
  - migration_path_provided
```

## 🎓 Learning from the Design

### Design Patterns Applied

1. **Facade Pattern**: kvmhost_setup provides a simple interface to complex subsystems
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different implementations for different platforms
3. **Observer Pattern**: Roles react to changes in system state
4. **Template Method Pattern**: Common task patterns with role-specific implementations

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality, add complexity gradually
2. **Define Interfaces Early**: Clear interfaces prevent integration issues
3. **Test Boundaries**: Test role interactions as much as individual roles
4. **Document Decisions**: ADRs capture the reasoning behind design choices
