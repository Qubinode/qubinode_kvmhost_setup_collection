# Tutorials - Learning-Oriented Documentation

Welcome to the tutorials section! These step-by-step guides are designed to help you learn by doing. Each tutorial focuses on getting you started with the Qubinode KVM Host Setup Collection and building your confidence through hands-on experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Find Here

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** and designed for newcomers who want to:
- Get started with the collection quickly
- Learn fundamental concepts through practical examples
- Build confidence with guided, step-by-step instructions
- Understand how different components work together

## ðŸ“‹ Available Tutorials

### Getting Started
- [Your First KVM Host Setup](01-first-kvm-host-setup.md) - Complete walkthrough from installation to running VMs
- [Basic Network Configuration](02-basic-network-configuration.md) - Set up networking for your KVM environment
- [Storage Pool Creation](03-storage-pool-creation.md) - Create and manage storage for virtual machines

### Intermediate Tutorials

## ðŸŽ“ Tutorial Characteristics

Each tutorial in this section:
- **Starts from the beginning** - No prior knowledge assumed
- **Is hands-on** - You'll actually configure a real KVM environment
- **Has a clear learning outcome** - You'll know what you've accomplished
- **Uses the deployed collection** - Works with installed collection, not source code
- **Is safe to follow** - Won't break existing systems when followed correctly

## ðŸš€ Before You Start
