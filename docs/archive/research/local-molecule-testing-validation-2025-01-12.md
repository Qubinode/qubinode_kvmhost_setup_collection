### 5. CI/CD Integration and Consistency

**Priority**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Type**: Integration Research

**Research Questions**:
1. How can we ensure local test results match CI/CD test results consistently?
2. What differences between local and CI/CD environments need to be documented and addressed?
3. How should we handle environment-specific test configurations?
4. What validation should occur to prevent "works on my machine" issues?
5. How can we make CI/CD test results more useful for local debugging?

**Methodology**:
- Comparison testing between local and CI/CD environments
- Environment difference analysis
- Integration point evaluation

**Success Criteria**:
