## Completed Research Projects

### ✅ RHEL 9/10 Support & CI/CD Automation (2024-07-11 → 2025-07-11)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Research findings and recommendations available
- **Duration**: 1 year comprehensive research
- **Priority**: High
- **Completion Date**: July 11, 2025
- **RHEL 10 Status**: Generally Available (GA announced at Red Hat Summit May 2025)

#### Research Documents
- [**Research Questions**](research-questions-rhel-9-10-support-2024-07-11.md) - Comprehensive research questions and methodology
- [**Research Results**](research-results-july-11-2025.md) - ⭐ **Complete research findings with actionable recommendations**
- [**Research Tracking**](research-tracking-rhel-9-10-2024-07-11.md) - Implementation roadmap and progress tracking

#### Key Research Areas (All Completed ✅)
1. **✅ RHEL Ecosystem Compatibility** - Multi-distribution testing strategy across RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, CentOS Stream
2. **✅ Dependabot Integration** - Multi-registry dependency management with limitations analysis
3. **✅ Migration Strategy** - Complement existing tools approach (Leapp, migrate2rocky, ELevate)
4. **✅ Performance & Security** - KVM/libvirt optimizations and universal security baselines
5. **✅ CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement** - Self-hosted runner requirements and tiered testing strategy

#### Critical Research Findings
- **Infrastructure**: Self-hosted GitHub Actions runners essential for KVM testing (cloud runners lack virtualization)
- **Architecture**: RHEL 9.4 deprecated monolithic libvirtd → requires modular libvirt daemon migration
- **Testing**: Multi-distribution matrix with container optimization (Minimal/Micro → Base/Default)
- **Dependencies**: Multi-registry Dependabot with manual oversight for complex scenarios
- **Migration**: Focus on pre/post-migration validation rather than replacing OS migration tools

#### Implementation Ready
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure foundation with self-hosted runners and multi-registry Dependabot
- **Phase 2**: Distribution-aware Ansible roles with conditional logic and performance optimizations
- **Phase 3**: Production readiness with comprehensive testing and community integration

## Implementation Phase

### Next Steps: From Research to Implementation
**Current Status**: Transitioning from research completion to implementation based on findings

**Priority Implementation Areas** (Based on Research Recommendations):
1. **Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Infrastructure** - Essential for KVM testing capabilities
2. **Multi-Registry Dependabot Configuration** - Comprehensive RHEL ecosystem dependency tracking  
3. **Distribution-Aware Ansible Role Development** - Conditional logic for universal RHEL support
4. **Modular Libvirt Daemon Migration** - Address RHEL 9.4 architectural changes
5. **Performance & Security Integration** - KVM optimizations and crypto policy implementations

## Research Process

### 1. Question Generation
Research questions are generated based on:
- Existing architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Project requirements and constraints
- Industry best practices and standards
- Team knowledge gaps and priorities

### 2. Research Execution
- Structured research methodology
- Evidence-based analysis
- Prototype development and testing
- Stakeholder feedback integration

### 3. Documentation & Implementation
- Comprehensive research documentation
- Implementation guidance and recommendations
- Knowledge transfer and training
- Production deployment planning

## Guidelines for Contributors

### Creating New Research
1. Use the established research question template
2. Link to relevant ADRs and architectural decisions
3. Define clear success criteria and metrics
4. Establish realistic timelines and resource requirements

### Research Documentation Standards
- Clear, actionable research questions
- Evidence-based methodology
- Regular progress tracking and updates
- Comprehensive results documentation

### File Naming Conventions
- Research Questions: `research-questions-[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Research Tracking: `research-tracking-[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Research Results: `research-results-[topic]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Integration with ADRs

Research findings directly inform architectural decisions:
- Research validates proposed architectural changes
- Research results become evidence for new ADRs
- Research identifies gaps in existing architectural decisions
- Research guides future architectural evolution

## Contact & Support

For questions about research processes or specific research projects:
- Review existing research documentation
- Consult relevant ADRs for architectural context
- Follow established research methodologies
- Engage with project maintainers for guidance
